# ACS_Hackathon

- A simple model using Support Vector Machine has been created to suggest a likelhood of someone contracting the COVID-19 virus.
- This likelihood is computed by a naive approach of assuming conditional independence amongst the parameters such as location, age, etc.
Screenshots of the data set are as follows:
## Inital Datasets obtained from health websites
- Hotspot Regions in NSW
